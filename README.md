# Option Value Visibility

![Screenshot](/images/screenshot.png)

This extension provides the ability to flag an option value for public or admin visibility. This is particularly useful when configuring custom fields for which you want to limit what options are exposed to frontend forms.

From within the Edit Multiple Choice Options add a new option or edit an existing option and set the Visible field as desired.
